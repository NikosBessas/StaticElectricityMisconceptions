**Introduction**

This repository contains data and analysis from a study on the misconceptions of Greek middle school students regarding the concept of static electricity. The study utilized a structured questionnaire to assess students' understanding and certainty about various scenarios involving staic electricity.

****Questionnaire Structure**

The questionnaire consisted of 24 questions, each divided into four parts:

**Part 1: Multiple Choice Question (MCQ)**

Each question presents a scenario related to hydrostatic pressure with several possible answers. Responses are coded as 0 for incorrect answers and 1 for correct answers.

**Part 2: Confidence Level for Part 1**

Participants indicate their confidence in their answer to Part 1 by choosing between: "I am sure" (coded as 1) "I am not sure" (coded as 0)

**Part 3: Justification for Part 1 Answer**

Participants provide a reason for their choice in Part 1 through multiple-choice options. Justifications are coded as 0 for incorrect reasoning and 1 for correct reasoning.

**Part 4: Confidence Level for Part 3**

Participants indicate their confidence in their justification by choosing between: "I am sure" (coded as 1) "I am not sure" (coded as 0)

****Data Description**

The dataset provided includes the responses from the questionnaire, with each row representing an individual student's responses to the 24 questions. Each question's four parts are recorded in separate columns, following the coding scheme described above.
